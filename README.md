# my to do list website project

## about
### Can you believe it? My second Spring boot project, I already feel like I'm getting better at doing back end coding.
### But enough about me more about the project:
### This project was made in collaboration with a excellent dev and a good friend of mine who handled the front end, while I handled all the back end aspect using Spring boot.
### Why was this project made? I was simply procrastinating working on another one of my project and I remembered I had this project on my To do list, so I decided to finish this instead

## Special thanks
### I would like to thank my friend and partner on this project [devilishlyney](https://github.com/devilishlyney) for the wonderful css, I do hope you check his page out and see the amazing projects he has worked on and find something even better than this simple to do list website.
